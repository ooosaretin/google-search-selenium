For a **Google Search Selenium Automated Test** with video and screenshot recordings in your GitHub repository, your README should clearly outline the project’s purpose, setup, execution, and details about the recordings. Here's an example of how to structure your README:

# Google Search Selenium Automated Test

This repository contains an automated test suite for **Google Search** using **Selenium WebDriver**. The test automates a search query on Google, performs basic validations, and captures **video** and **screenshots** during test execution for better visualization and debugging.

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to use **Selenium WebDriver** for end-to-end testing of Google Search. The test checks the basic search functionality, including validating the visibility of search results and performing assertions. Video and screenshots of the test execution are captured to provide a visual record.

## Features
- Automated testing with **Selenium WebDriver**.
- Validates Google search results.
- Captures **video** of the test execution.
- Takes **screenshots** during the test for visual verification.
- Supports **Java** (or any other language you’re using for Selenium).
- Simple setup and usage instructions.

## Prerequisites
To run the test, ensure you have the following installed:
- [Java](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html) (version 8 or higher) or the relevant language bindings for Selenium.
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) (for Java-based setup).
- [Selenium WebDriver](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/en/webdriver/) (latest version).
- [ChromeDriver](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/) (or another driver if using a different browser).
- [FFMPEG](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) (for video recording).
  
## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/google-search-selenium-test.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd google-search-selenium-test
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   - If you're using **Maven**:
     ```bash
     mvn install
     ```

   - For other setups, ensure all necessary dependencies are included in your project configuration file (e.g., `pom.xml` for Maven or `build.gradle` for Gradle).

4. **Download WebDriver**:
   - Ensure that **ChromeDriver** or another appropriate WebDriver is installed and placed in a directory that is included in your system's PATH.

## Usage

1. **Run the tests**:
   - To run the tests using Maven:
     ```bash
     mvn test
     ```

2. The test will execute and you can monitor the status in the terminal. Upon completion, the test will generate a video and screenshots.

3. If you're using another setup (like Gradle or a different programming language for Selenium), adjust the command accordingly.

### Test Recording
During test execution, **video recordings** and **screenshots** will be automatically saved. These recordings and screenshots are helpful for debugging or verifying test results.

- The **video** will capture the full execution of the test (e.g., browser actions, search results, etc.).
- **Screenshots** will be taken at key points, such as before and after submitting the search query.

### Viewing the Test Recordings
1. **Video**: After running the test, the video file will be stored in the `target/videos/` folder (for Maven projects) or another specified output directory.
2. **Screenshots**: Screenshots will be saved in the `target/screenshots/` folder (or equivalent directory).

**Example screenshot from the test execution:**

To view the **video**, navigate to the `target/videos/` folder and open the `.mp4` file corresponding to your test run (e.g., `google-search-test.mp4`).

### Additional Notes:
1. **Video/Recording Setup**: If you're using a custom solution for video recording (e.g., using FFMPEG or a similar tool), mention it in the README and provide a brief setup guide on how to install/configure it.
2. **Customization**: Adjust the setup and installation sections depending on the programming language (Java, Python, etc.) and any additional tools you're using, such as test frameworks or utilities.
3. **Test Execution Instructions**: Be sure to include any platform-specific details, such as requirements for running the tests on Windows, Mac, or Linux.

This README structure will help users understand the project's functionality, how to set it up, and how to view test results through video and screenshots.
