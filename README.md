For a **Google Search Selenium Automated Test** written in **JavaScript** with video and screenshot recordings, the README should be clear and informative, guiding users through the installation, usage, and viewing of test results. Here's a detailed example of what to include in the README file:

# Google Search Selenium Automated Test (JavaScript)

This repository contains an automated test for **Google Search** using **Selenium WebDriver** in **JavaScript**. The test automates a Google search query, validates search results, and captures **video** and **screenshots** during the execution to visualize and debug the process.

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to use **Selenium WebDriver** in **JavaScript** to perform automated testing on Google Search. The test performs a search query, checks for specific elements on the results page, and saves video and screenshot recordings of the test execution. This helps with debugging and visual verification.

## Features
- **Selenium WebDriver** for automated testing.
- Validates Google search results.
- **Video recording** of test execution.
- **Screenshots** captured at key moments in the test.
- Supports headless browser mode for CI/CD.
- Easy to set up and run using **Node.js** and **NPM**.

## Prerequisites
Before running the test, you need to have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 12 or higher)
- [Selenium WebDriver](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/en/webdriver/) for JavaScript
- [ChromeDriver](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/) (or another driver if using a different browser)
- [FFMPEG](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) for video recording (if you're capturing videos)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/google-search-selenium.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd google-search-selenium
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   Run the following command to install all the required Node.js dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Download the WebDriver**:
   - Ensure that **ChromeDriver** or the appropriate WebDriver for your browser is installed and available in your system’s PATH.
   - You can download **ChromeDriver** from [here](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/).

5. **Set up FFMPEG for video recording**:
   - If you're using **FFMPEG** for video recording, make sure it's installed on your system. You can download it from [FFMPEG’s website](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html).

## Usage

1. **Run the test**:
   To execute the test, use the following command:
   ```bash
   node GoogleSearchTest/GoogleSearchSelenium.js
   ```

2. By default, the tests will run in headless mode (without opening a browser window). If you prefer to see the test execution in the browser, you can change the browser options in your test script to run in non-headless mode.

3. The tests will execute, and you can track progress in the terminal. Upon completion, video and screenshot files will be saved in designated directories.

### Viewing Test Results

- **Video**: The video of the test execution will be saved in the `videos/` directory.
  - Example: `videos/google-search-test.mp4`
- **Screenshots**: Screenshots will be stored in the `screenshots/` directory at specific points during the test.
  - Example: `screenshots/google-search-result.png`

### Example Screenshot

## Test Recording

During the execution of the Selenium test, **video recordings** and **screenshots** will be captured. These provide a visual record of the test and can help with debugging or verifying the behavior of the application.

- **Video Recording**: Captures the entire test execution in real-time. It can be viewed in video players like VLC.
- **Screenshots**: Captures screenshots at key points (e.g., before and after submitting the search query).

### Where to find the recordings:

- **Videos** are stored in the `videos/` directory.
- **Screenshots** are stored in the `screenshots/` directory.

### Example of video playback:

1. Navigate to the `videos/` folder.
2. Find the video file corresponding to the test run (e.g., `google-search-test.mp4`).
3. Play the video to view the test execution.

## Contributing

### Additional Tips:
1. **Customizing Video Recording**: If you're using custom libraries for video recording (like `ffmpeg` or other tools), provide setup instructions in the README, including how to install and configure them.
   
2. **JavaScript Setup**: If you're using frameworks like **Mocha** or **Jest** for testing with Selenium, include information about how to run tests with those tools, and modify the test commands accordingly.

3. **Troubleshooting**: If there are common issues (like WebDriver setup or video recording issues), consider adding a **Troubleshooting** section.

This structure ensures that users understand how to set up the project, run tests, and view recorded results like videos and screenshots, making it easy to use and debug.
